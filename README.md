# Slides Kafka Fundamentals

This is a presentation about Kafka Fundamentals, i.e. things that every engineer working with Kafka
and expecting reliable messaging (e.g. in the context of event collaboration) should know.

It covers (java) producers, consumers and the cluster itself, i.e. topic partitions, replicas etc.
It's <em>not</em> about e.g. Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams or  3rd party client libraries like spring-kafka or reactor-kafka.
